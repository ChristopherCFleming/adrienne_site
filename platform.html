									Find out more about Adrienne’s policy positions below.
								<ul>
									<h3>Childcare Support and Youth Development</h3>
									<p>
										<i>Adrienne has a toddler in daycare–she knows the costs and has actively researched CPS and afterschool programs.
										Adrienne’s first role in Cambridge was working to support immigrants, first generation, and students of color through
										Cambridge’s <a href="https://www.enrooteducation.org/" target="_blank">Enroot</a> and <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Departments/humanserviceprograms/collegesuccess" target="_blank">College Success</a> Programs. <b>We want families to be able to afford to stay in Cambridge, and we need
										to invest more in this area.</b></i>
									</p>
									<li>
										<b>Extend universal pre-K to all 2- and 3-year-olds.</b> <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/newsandevents/News/2023/05/universalpreschoolupdate.aspx" target="_blank">The current expansion</a> to 4-year-olds is welcome but doesn’t go far
										enough. This is a question of family economics and brain science. We want all Cambridge’s children to be exposed to
										developmentally-appropriate, consistent, and nurturing opportunities.
									</li>
									<li>
										Increase Cambridge's local <b>tuition assistance</b> and <a href="https://earlychildhoodcambridge.org/for-families/#:~:text=The%20Office%20of%20Early%20Childhood%20Scholarship%20Program,of%20our%20partner%20preschool%20programs." target="_blank">scholarship programs</a> to help eligible families find and pay for
										childcare and afterschool.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Strengthen the relationship between School Committee and City Council</b> to better coordinate and communicate with parents
										and the community, and to avoid surprises like the removal of <a href="https://www.boston.com/news/the-boston-globe/2023/07/18/cambridge-schools-are-divided-over-middle-school-algebra/" target="_blank">algebra</a> from the 8th grade curriculum and imminent
										elementary school <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/185nn938piJEa3BcIgBUVpRbiYuoGH4gM/view" target="_blank"></a>scheduling changes.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Expand early college programs.</b> Currently CRLS partners with two higher ed institutions and serves around 100 students.
										Early college programs like this are proven to help students of color, first generation college students, and immigrants
										graduate earlier and with less debt. Adrienne wants to see this program expand exponentially.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<h3>Transparency and Access to Public Services</h3>
									<p>
										<i>
											Adrienne has helped hundreds of individuals access services in Cambridge, including her own family. From subsidized
											housing applications to support paying overdue bills and trying to open a small business. <b>She knows the barriers
											residents must overcome to get existing city services, and she knows what services that we still need to develop.</b>
										</i>
									</p>
									<li>
										Encourage participation in local government through <b>public financing for municipal elections</b> and limiting money from
										developers and special interest groups.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Provide additional technical support</b> to diverse residents attempting to access services.
									</li>
									<ol>
										<li>
											Institute a municipal IT helpdesk so residents can more easily <b>access city services online.</b>
										</li>
										<li>
											Initiate technical assistance programs that <b>connect residents with vendors and information</b>, like the newly introduced
											<a href="https://abodeem.com/homeowners/community-programs/cambridge/" target="_blank">Electrify Cambridge.</a>
										</li>
										<li>
											Create a <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5fb554c6bcf4c950ed250c4f/t/62221899b883ee48be08fc42/1646401706607/Cambridge+Homelessness+Report+FINAL+January+2022.pdf" target="_blank">dedicated housing search position</a> at the <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/Services/HomelessandEvictionPreventionServices" target="_blank">Multi-Service Center</a> to work with the homeless population.
										</li>
									</ol>
									<li>
										<b>Translate City materials (forms, guides, applications) into multiple languages.</b> The City currently has abundant
										resources, but they are rarely available in the <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/cdd/factsandmaps/demographicfaq">diverse languages our residents speak.</a> Adrienne would advocate starting
										with the Community Development Department’s resources which include housing and business opportunities, and then
										expanding rapidly to create fully accessible external facing materials.
									</li>
									<li>
										Adrienne is committed to <b>intentional, ongoing engagement with non-native English speakers, youth, and seniors</b> to ensure
										they have full access to the resources and services of the city.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<ul>
									<h3>Business and Workforce Development</h3>
									<p>
										<i>
											Adrienne’s husband is an aspiring entrepreneur who has worked at small businesses here in Cambridge. She lives in a
											neighborhood full of long-standing shops and too many empty storefronts. <b>She wants to see a thriving, bustling, and
											diverse economy, where residents can access the goods and services they need while supporting our local businesses. To
											achieve that we need to improve communication with small businesses and expand resources to support an evolving city.</b>
										</i>
									</p>
									<li>
										Assist business owners struggling to keep up with the rising costs of operating in Cambridge by creating <b>inclusive
										zoning for businesses</b> and exploring City administered grants and 0% interest loans.
									</li>
									<li>
										Make Cambridge an easier place to do business by <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/CDD/zoninganddevelopment/Zoning/Maps" target="_blank">updating zoning tables</a> to <b>support the creation of more businesses and
										affordable housing</b> and allow for a wider variety of businesses to operate in Cambridge.
									</li>
									<li>
										<b>Promote equity in City contracts</b> by advocating for a percentage of City contracts to be set aside for diverse
										businesses, building on the <a href="https://cambridgemadisparitystudy.com/" target="_blank">spending disparity study</a> of awarded contracts.
									</li>
									<li>
										Adrienne <b>unequivocally supports unions</b> as well as expanding local training programs and partnerships. Cambridge is lucky
										to have robust training programs run by city departments and local nonprofit organizations that can be supplemented.
									</li>
								</ul>
