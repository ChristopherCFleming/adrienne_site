								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>I am an “essential worker”: mother, wife, daughter, friend, humanitarian worker, scientist and I am running to sustain
								our best future together in Cambridge. Throughout my career I have centered social justice-- imagining and working for
								an equitable world for everyone.
								<br/>
								<br />
								I was born and raised in Central Massachusetts to two social worker parents who were politically active promoting the
								rights of children and those with disabilities, as well as energetically supporting female candidates for office and
								general electoral participation. I was involved in these causes from an early age. I also started studying Spanish early
								on, encouraged by an aunt who was a Spanish teacher and regularly used her Spanish professionally. In college I spent
								time studying in Argentina working both with the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team identifying remains of victims of
								violence and with women searching for “disappeared” relatives who were being dismissed as “crazy.” I became interested
								in access to justice and fact creation, i.e. who was an expert, what counted as evidence, and why in the court of law.
								Shortly after graduating from Smith College, I had the opportunity to continue my research in Argentina with a Fulbright
								Research Fellowship.
								<br />
								<br />
								Upon my return to the US, I first worked for Project Bread connecting spanish-speaking residents from across the state
								to food resources in their communities, then at Cambridge Community Services (now Enroot), I worked with recent
								immigrant students on academic and civic engagement in their new community. While at Cambridge Community Services I
								became involved in the College Success Initiative, spearheading a program for community college students in response to
								an identified need in the community to support college students who were struggling outside of Cambridge. This expanded
								Cambridge Community Services’ programming to a wider population of low-income students, not just immigrants, who were
								struggling academically. The College Success Initiative was run for two years by Cambridge Community Services, before
								being transferred to the City of Cambridge where it’s successfully been housed ever since.
								<br />
								<br />
								After three years with Cambridge Community Services, I realized I needed to take the advice I was giving to my students
								and pursue my dreams and continue to work internationally. I studied at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at
								Tufts University focusing on Human Security and Humanitarian Response, with the opportunity to complete coursework at
								the Harvard School of Public Health, the Friedman School of Nutrition, to collaborate with students and professors at
								MIT as well as advise an NGO in Sri Lanka. Upon graduation I moved to Kenya and then Nigeria to work with Action Against
								Hunger as part of a famine response. I left that role after reporting sexual harassment, and not finding support from my
								managerial team. I moved to Washington D.C. with many of my Fletcher colleagues, and was set to take a job at USAID when
								President Trump was elected, I could not work for his government. I was offered a position with the Carter Center to go
								Ethiopia, but under Trump the visa application process was so delayed that I was unable to gain authorization.
								<br />
								<br />
								After a few months I accepted a position in New York with John Jay College of Criminal Justice in a research center
								focused on lowering homicides. The team worked mainly in US cities with a framework called “focused deterrence” that was
								extraordinarily successful in reducing local “group” homicide rates. I joined their newly minted “international
								initiative” and worked with teams across the globe on translating this framework to the international context,
								specifically working with governments in Sweden, Mexico, El Salvador, and Brazil. I also co-advised a portfolio of
								cities in the United States, but when police shootings of Black women and men (specifically Breonna Taylor and George
								Floyd) gained national attention I left my role because I did not agree with the way my organization was responding
								internally or externally. There were other ways I could support my community.
								<br />
								<br />
								While in New York I had volunteered with the New Sanctuary Coalition, translating asylum applications as part of a
								pro-se clinic and leading a team of volunteers that went to the border with Mexico to meet one of the Migrant Caravans
								and advise them of their legal rights. When the pandemic broke, I worked with the Medical Reserve Corps on the COVID
								response, spending April in the refrigerated trailers in NYC. I joined New York City’s Health and Hospital team as a
								Public Health Advisor, providing case management to Spanish speaking residents across the city who tested positive for
								COVID 19.
								<br />
								<br />
								Then my mom’s Parkinson’s became so bad that I realized I needed to move home to Massachusetts to support my parents. I
								started to apply to positions and was lucky enough to have the opportunity to move back to Cambridge to work with Mayor
								Siddiqui. I’ve worked with Mayor Siddiqui for the past three years as her Director of Constituent Services. During that
								time I also got married to my Argentine husband, navigated immigration process, had my first baby and then became a
								heart mom, as my son had to have open heart surgery at 21 days. Working as a municipal employee provided me the
								flexibility I needed to be able to continue to work to support my family while being available for the additional
								medical and migration related needs. My son’s first language is Spanish, we’ve navigated challenges in Cambridge in
								locating a midwife who spoke spanish (there were no fluent speaking midwives at Mount Auburn so we needed to contract
								with a private Doula),a native-spanish speaking pediatrician (there is none), navigating Boston Children’s Hospital’s
								various departments with my husband, and the job search and dream of opening a small business for my husband with
								minimal resources available for non-native speakers. These experiences, so common to our residents in Cambridge--caring
								for an elder, balancing work responsibilities with others roles such as being a wife and mother, combined with my
								international work experience, are what are leading me to run for office, to help other individuals, children, mothers,
								and families in Cambridge as we create our future together.
								<br />
								<br />
								Mayor Siddiqui has spearheaded initiatives I support and am proud to be a part of-- from the Cambridge Rise and Rise Up
								programs to Early College, Cambridge Promise and Universal PreK. She has advocated for increased affordable housing and
								inclusion in the city, initiating celebrations that incorporate a wider range of identities than previously publicly
								funded. Her representation, as an immigrant, young woman, person of color is inspiring to me personally, but hopefully
								also an example for my son of what is possible growing up in Cambridge. I am going to raise my family here, and I am
								therefore dedicated to ensuring that Cambridge is as inclusive a city as possible. My focuses are: family, equal access
								to resources and justice, and leaving the world in a better position for my son (politically, environmentally, socially)
								and everyone in Cambridge.
