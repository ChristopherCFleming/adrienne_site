								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>Adrienne is an “essential worker”: a mother, wife, daughter, friend, humanitarian worker, scientist and I am running to
								sustain our best future together in Cambridge. Throughout her career she has centered social justice—championing,
								imagining, and working for an equitable world for everyone.
								<br/>
								<br />
								Adrienne was born and raised in Central Massachusetts by two social worker parents who were politically active promoting
								the rights of children and those with disabilities. They also energetically supported female candidates in office. She
								was therefore exposed to and involved in activism for these causes from an early age. Adrienne started studying Spanish
								early on, encouraged by an aunt who was a Spanish teacher and has regularly used her Spanish professionally. In college
								she spent time studying in Argentina working both with the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team identifying remains of
								victims of violence and with women who were being dismissed as “crazy” because they were searching for “disappeared”
								relatives. She became interested in access to justice and fact creation, i.e. who was an expert, what counted as
								evidence, and why in the court of law. Shortly after graduating from Smith College, she had the opportunity to continue
								her research in Argentina with a Fulbright Research Fellowship.
								<br />
								<br />
								Upon returning to the US, she first worked for Project Bread connecting Spanish-speaking residents from across the state
								to food resources in their communities, then at Cambridge Community Services (now Enroot), where she worked with recent
								immigrant students on academic and civic engagement in their new community. While at Cambridge Community Services she
								became involved in the College Success Initiative, spearheading a program for community college students. This expanded
								Cambridge Community Services’ programming to a wider population of low-income students, not just immigrants, who were
								struggling academically. The College Success Initiative was run for two years by Cambridge Community Services, before
								being transferred to the City of Cambridge where it’s successfully been housed ever since.
								<br />
								<br />
								After three years with Cambridge Community Services, Adrienne realized she needed to take the advice she was giving to
								students, and pursue her dreams of continuing to work internationally. She enrolled at the Fletcher School of Law and
								Diplomacy at Tufts University focusing on Human Security and Humanitarian Response, with the opportunity to complete
								coursework at the Harvard School of Public Health, the Friedman School of Nutrition, to collaborate with students and
								professors at MIT, as well as advise an NGO in Sri Lanka. Upon graduation she moved to Kenya and then Nigeria to work
								with Action Against Hunger as part of a famine response. She left that role after reporting sexual harassment, and not
								finding support from the managerial team. She moved to Washington D.C. with many of her Fletcher colleagues, and was set
								to take a job at USAID when President Trump was elected. She was not willing to work for his government. She was offered
								a position with the Carter Center to go Ethiopia, but under Trump the visa application process was so delayed that she
								was unable to gain authorization.
								<br />
								<br />
								After a few months she accepted a position in New York with John Jay College of Criminal Justice in a research center
								focused on lowering homicides. The team worked mainly in US cities with a framework called “focused deterrence” that was
								extraordinarily successful in reducing local “group” homicide rates. She joined their newly minted “international
								initiative” and worked with teams across the globe on translating this framework to the international context,
								specifically working with governments in Sweden, Mexico, El Salvador, and Brazil. She also co-advised a portfolio of
								cities in the United States, but when police shootings of Black women and men (specifically Breonna Taylor and George
								Floyd) (re)gained national attention, she left my role because she did not agree with the way the organization was
								responding internally or externally. There were other ways she knew she could support the community.
								<br />
								<br />
								While in New York she had volunteered with the New Sanctuary Coalition, translating asylum applications as part of a
								pro-se clinic and leading a team of volunteers that went to the border with Mexico to meet one of the Migrant Caravans
								and advise them of their legal rights. When the pandemic broke, she worked with the Medical Reserve Corps on the COVID
								response, spending April in the refrigerated trailers in NYC. She then joined New York City’s Health and Hospital team
								as a Public Health Advisor, providing case management to Spanish speaking residents across the city who tested positive
								for COVID 19.
								<br />
								<br />
								Her mom’s Parkinson’s diagnose prompted her to move home to Massachusetts to support her parents. She started to apply
								to positions and was lucky enough to have the opportunity to move back to Cambridge to work for Mayor Siddiqui. She’s
								worked with Mayor Siddiqui for the past three years as her Director of Constituent Services. During that time, she also
								got married to her Argentine husband, navigated the harrowing immigration process, had her first baby and then became a
								heart mom, as her son had to have open heart surgery. Working as a municipal employee, she was afforded the flexibility
								she needed to be able to continue to work to support her family while being available for the additional medical and
								migration related needs. Her husband and her son’s first language is Spanish. Together they’ve navigated language access
								challenges, for example there were no spanish speaking midwives at Mount Auburn Hospital where she chose to deliver.
								There are no native spanish speaking pediatricians in any practice in Cambridge. They have navigated the job search for
								her husband and are currently pursuing his dream of opening a small business despite minimal resources available for
								non-native speakers. These experiences, so common to our residents in Cambridge--caring for an elder, balancing work
								responsibilities with others roles such as being a wife and mother-- combined with her international work experience,
								are what are led her to run for office, to help other individuals, children, mothers, and families in Cambridge create a
								bright future together.
								<br />
								<br />
								Mayor Siddiqui has spearheaded initiatives Adrienne supports and she is proud to be a part of-- from the Cambridge Rise
								and Rise Up guaranteed income programs to Early College, Cambridge Promise and Universal PreK. The Mayor has advocated
								for increased affordable housing and inclusion in the city, initiating celebrations that incorporate a wider range of
								identities than previously publicly funded. Her representation, as an immigrant, young woman, and person of color is
								inspiring to Adrienne, and also an example for her son of what is possible growing up in Cambridge. She is going to
								raise her family here, and is therefore dedicated to ensuring that Cambridge is as inclusive a city as possible. As a
								candidate, and as a mother and community member, her focuses are: family, equal access to resources and justice, and
								leaving the world in a better position for my son and for everyone in Cambridge (politically, environmentally,
								socially).
